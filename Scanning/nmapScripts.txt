cd to /usr/share/nmap/scripts to look for the scripts

Look for script names using ls | grep ssh (example)

After getting name, run script from anywhere using:

nmap --script=="script name" ip

scripts can be edited too, like ssh-brute force

after downloading additional repos for vulnerability scanning,
run it using, from the directory containing these repos:

nmap --script "repo name, another repo name (if wanted two or more at the same time)" "options" ip

number shows amount of vulnerability in case of vulners, and click on link for more info

to search for exploit, just google the name of vulnerability + "exploit"

amap: alternative version of amap
